# -!Cheating-
Question Assistant - that helps with questions (only use it for practice questions )

URL encoding for ! is (%21)  

but sadly git hub repo has it's constraints (Your repository will be NOT be renamed as -!Cheating-.
The repository name can only contain ASCII letters, digits, and the characters ., - and _.)
so here _21 stands for %21 which then stands for !

is it convoluted? maybe? but lowkey what isnt here
